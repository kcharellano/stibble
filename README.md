## Motivation
The motivation behind this app was to replicate [Orange Guidance Soapstone messages](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Messages) as they work in the popular action role playing game [dark souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls). 

In the game, players can leave short messages anywhere on the ground and they appear when another player gets close enough to the location where the messages was written.

## General info
Stibble attempts to mimic this functionality by allowing users to write messages that appear on a google map when another user gets close enough. Messages can be rated by other users using a +1/-1 system with ratings either prolonging or decreasing the lifetime of the message.
